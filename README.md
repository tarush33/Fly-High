# Fly-High
Fly high is a helicopter game developed using OpenGL library in C++. The basic idea of the game is to dodge the rectangles and the game ends when the helicopter touches one of the rectangles.
The score is calculated based on the distance covered by the helicopter before the crash.

# How to play 
The game is to move the helicopter up and down using function keys from the keyboard or the mouse and to save the helicopter from either crashing with the obstacles moving towards the
helicopter or from crashing up and down in the frame.<br>
<br>
You can move the helicopter up by pressing ‘w’ from the keyboard or ‘left click’ from the
mouse. You can move the helicopter down by pressing ‘m’ from the keyboard or it will
automatically move down when released free.
